# **PyBer_Analysis**
## **Project Overview**

The purpose of this project was to perform a summarized analysis of ride-share data by different city types - rural, suburban and urban - and create a vizualized representation of the data for PyBer CEO, V. Isualize. Within this analysis, I utilized Python and Pandas fundamentals, coupled with Matplotlib to create the corresponding charts.

## **Results**

![Chart Summary](https://github.com/mhenson1989/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/ChartSummary.PNG)

The chart above represents the summarized totals of drivers, rides and fares by city type (rural, suburban and urban), as well as the average fare per ride and average fare per driver, by type. Overall, as possibly anticipated, the Total Number of Rides and Drivers in Urban areas is the highest. Adversely, rural areas have the lowest number of rides and drivers, which aligns with the general landscape of each area type. However, since the volume of riders and drivers in rural city types is low, this consequently increases their overall average fare per ride and driver. Rural city types have the highest fare averages, second to rural and then urban, which aligns with the hypothesis that volume of rides effects fare.

In the chart above, you can see Total Fare by City Type by Week. From January to May, you see the most consistent spike in fare amount for all three city types at the end of February. Overally, the total fares are the largest in urban areas. Even if their average fare per ride is the lowest, by volume, they are averaging 2 1/2 times as many rides as Suburan city types and 13 times as many rides as Rural city types, thus increasing their overall total revenue from fares. 


## **Summary**
*Recommendations*

1. Continued Focus in Urban City Types
    - As seen by the line chart above, Total Urban Fares are consistently driving the highest amount of revenue, despite having a lower average fare per ride and driver percentage. Volume alone in an urban city type is producing consistent results. 
2. Suburban City Types is an Area of Opportunity
    - Though never fully competing at the volume and revenue of the urban city types, the Suburban city type is driving a consistent level of revenue with less overall rides and drivers - this means that the Suburban city type is using less resources, but still yielding high revenue. There is opportunity here to bolster increased revenue by increasing marketing about the PyBer rideshare program. I would recommend not increasing the overall number of drivers in this area, but target marketing about using the program, which will drive demand, increase rides and also fare prices. This model could compete with the urban type, if done successfully. 
3. Reduce Total Number of Drivers in Rural Areas
    - The majority of high fares in rural areas is due to distance and availibility. Further reducing the number of drivers in rural areas will consequently stretch demand by riders, which will further drive fare price.
